# Tungusta
Tungusta is a simple page framework I will be using in my personal projects. It's still under development. It's designed with my own wishes and desires in mind and not necessarily for public use.

## Motivation

I code apps and projects on a daily basis. Most of these projects always have fundamentally the same features with only the difference being the specific details. For example when 
it comes to user interface, we tend to have CRUD pages with edittexts, an image picker, buttons etc. When it comes to detail page a collapsing toolbar layout, some textviews, floating action
button. For listing pages a recyclerview, maybe a carousel view, endless scroll pagination etc. In this repository I will be defining base activities that I will be extending
in those projects. These will define me the base common features so that I don't have to waste my time duplicating them in every project. 

## Installation

In the root build.
